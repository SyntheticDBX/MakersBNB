# Templates Guide 

This folder contains HTML elements and snippets for our site, I've tried to collate the most essential elements in order to make the testing of routes(methods and paths) much easier. 

None of the designs are final decisions, feel free to add in your ideas!

### Proposals 

- remove book button from gallery cards
- replace book button with location info per listing 
- incorp a simple solution for date selection per listing (drop down??)
- consider validation options for forms (Bootstrap has form frontend options)
- consider date validation 
- consider if a dates table provides some solutions 
- refer to mockups to finalise some design features 
- incorporate some features for users who are hosts to view requests 



## Template

this is for any additional page to be added to the site 


## Home

this is the user view when logged out of the site 

## Sign Up / Register

a form to register for the site, on its separate page 


## Preview

this is a limited view of listings, all listings will be shown when the user is logged in

## Log In 

a form to enter username or email(we can use only one of these options for simplicity) and password

## Gallery 

a portfolio view of all listings with links to view an individual listing and a link to make a booking

Need to incorp a solution that prevents checkout before selecting and submitting dates

## Listing

this should be an individual page for a listing

## Checkout

this contains an example form for making a booking with additional payment submission design (None of this is essential, it just serves as an example)
