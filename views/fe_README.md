erb navigation should now be working 

will be attempting to: 
- incorp div code blocks
- demarcate dynamic elements 
- test js script with routes

- test form validation 
- remove elements which are no longer needed
- update snippets for next sprint


# TO DO / in progress
- replace book button with location info per listing 
- remove book button from gallery cards 
- consider validation options for forms (Bootstrap has form frontend options)
- implement a solution for  date validation 
- incorporate some features for users who are hosts to view requests 

# Done
- refer to mockups to finalise some design features
- create basic routes as per final design with erb files
