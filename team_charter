We are team **HashItOut**

Bearing in mind the EQ learning weâ€™ve done with Dana and elsewhere, we want to foster a good team to work in

Our practices
- Starting slow
- Problems when pairing -> blockers -> escalate to group.
- Collate the questions to ask ing the morning.
- Sharing knowledge throughout the group
- Regularly updating Trello tickets (e.g. comments)
- If the code isn't clear then add comments.
- Proper variable naming

Code review after morning stand up (part of the paring)


We plan to meet
At 10:15am for morning standup
  Mood checkins 
  code review
At 2pm for afternoon standup
At 5pm for a retro at the end of the day

We value:
  Honesty
  Compassion
  learning
  openness
(in that order)

We will have a nominated leader/spokesperson which will rotate daily

When we are upset we will raise it immediately in the Slack channel, separating the facts and the story as far as we are able, and giving actionable, specific and kind feedback as appropriate
